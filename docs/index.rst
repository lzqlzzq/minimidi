MiniMidi Documentation
======================

MiniMidi is a minimal, header-only MIDI parsing and serialization library. The documentation bundle contains:

1. A Getting Started guide covering integration, example builds, and contribution tips.
2. An automatically generated API reference sourced directly from the Doxygen comments inside the ``include/`` tree, ensuring the docs always mirror the C++ headers.
